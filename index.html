<h1>Did you know that coding is really important?</h1>
<h1>  Well, coding has lots of really great benefits.  
  First off, our minds can activate our learning centers,
  by coding, that can possibly happen. Since coding requires 
  lots of complex skills, the brain adapts to reinforce 
  associations between distinct parts of the brain. Forming
  these intra brain connections is a great workout for the brain.</h1>
