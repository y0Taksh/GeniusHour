     <h1 style='color red'>Tech Neck</h1>
     <p>Tech neck, also known as text neck, refers to <mark>chronic neck pain</mark> caused by 
          continuously straining the neck muscles while using electronic devices like 
          phones, tablets, and computers.</p>
     <p>Over time, this strain can damage your muscles and misalign your spine, 
          leading to poor posture, joint inflammation, pinched nerves, and herniated discs</p>
     <h3> <mark>Here are some effects about tech neck:</mark></h3>
     <p>Muscle Lengthening and Shortening: Tech neck can lengthen the neck muscles and shorten the chest muscles, 
          resulting in a hunched posture that puts more pressure on your neck and slumps your shoulders.</p>
     <p>Shoulder and Neck Pain: The misalignment caused by tech neck leads to shoulder and neck pain, 
          soreness, and stiffness.</p>
     <p>Spinal Pressure and Nerve Pinching: Pressure on the spine can pinch nerves, 
          causing neck pain, lower back pain, and numbness or tingling in the hands.</p>
     <p>Rotator Cuff Issues: Forward-slumping shoulders can pinch and irritate 
          the tendons of the rotator cuff, leading to inflammation and shoulder pain.</p>
     <p>Other Health Issues: Tech neck can also contribute to lower 
          back pain, headaches, herniated discs, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain.</p>
     <p>Cervical Kyphosis: In some cases, tech neck may lead to the loss of the natural 
          C-shaped curvature of the neck, known as cervical kyphosis.</p>
     <h3><mark>Here are some ways to prevent tech neck:</mark></h3>
     <p>Be Mindful of Posture: Hold your phone at eye level to avoid looking down and bending your neck. When using a 
          computer, position your monitor or screen to look straight at it without bending your neck down or forward.</p>
     <p>Take Frequent Breaks: Stand up and move around to relieve strain from electronic devices.</p>
     <p>Monitor Distance: Place your screen about 20-30 inches away from your eyes (approximately an armâ€™s length).</p>
     <p>Elevate Your Screen: Use a computer monitor or laptop stand to position your screen at the right level.</p>
